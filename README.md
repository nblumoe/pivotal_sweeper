# Pivotal Sweeper

This does have some grander plans, but right now it just switches to a directory containing a git repository, looks up any unmerged branches on origin, and displays any stories labeled with the branch name on Pivotal Tracker.

# Instructions

Clone, copy `config.rb.example` to `config.rb` and edit, run, enjoy output.
